7. Practice, Practice, Practice
Implement algorithms and data structures from scratch to understand their inner workings.

Solve problems daily to improve your problem-solving ability.

Focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than just memorizing solutions.

Break down complex problems into smaller parts and solve each part iteratively.

Suggested Roadmap:
Weeks 1-2: Focus on arrays, strings, stacks, queues, and linked lists.

Weeks 3-4: Move on to trees, graphs, heaps, and hashmaps.

Weeks 5-6: Study sorting, searching, and begin with dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.

Weeks 7-8: Deep dive into advanced algorithms like divide and conquer, backtracking, and more complex dynamic programming problems.

Ongoing: Consistently practice problems, review your solutions, and optimize them for time and space complexity.
